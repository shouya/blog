    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It’s the first time I am involved in contributing KDE, and I think
that’s very wonderful experience for me.</p>

<p>The first task I claimed is convert the all class members in
calligra/kexi project to d-pointers. This task is not very hard to me
actually. Because that the source files and classes are so many, it
takes most of labors, and some experiences and ability to to cope with
exceptions. I’ve been leaving c++ for almost one year time, so totally
the most important thing I gained is to pick up c++ again. Further
more, I don’t used to know to use d-pointers to reduce coupling, and now I
learnt it, which is really cool.</p>

<p>Then I’ve contributed with marble-globe task. The task is about adding
remote icon/image support for marble. I got known about the typical
structure of a KDE programs, and I’m feeling like to program Qt, which
is really powerful and handy. And then by the passion, I wrote the
required KML tag writers for marble, too. These are interesting for
me.</p>

<p>Totally speaking the greatest gain is the achievement of contributing
open source projects. This is biggest open source project I’ve been
involved in, since before I used to just collaborate opensource
project with small groups or individuals on github before. Those
hackers I met are really friendly. I’m very careless. I made a lot of
mistakes, and even didn’t realize that. At those times, my mentor
always explained to me patiently &amp; gently, that made feel embarrassed
when finally I knew that’s my fault. And at the time, when I met
project-related problems that I can’t solve and not able to be
abstracted to ask on stackoverflow, I sent emails to my mentors and
they explained the reason of the problem clearly and gave me guidance
to solve it. I can feel that the hackers in open source community are
glad to help those beginners like me, and that’s really impressive for
me.</p>

<p>This is the first time &amp; will be the last that I could attend Google
Code-In, but I will continue work on contributing open source
projects. I love the atmosphere in open source communities and  I
would like to get acquainted to more hackers. Good luck.</p>

<p>That’s it, thanks to all.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Another month as you see.</p>

<p>While it seems that I changed nothing and actually base on Mutation I
was a completely new guy from the previous second.</p>

<p>Leave the useless words aside, I’m not a mutant as I always
concern. Yes, I know you all do not think how it does matter, while
you should know, I just seem like a bare body with soul losted(I’m
sorry as Mutation does not support souls), and rather, I
could touch the soul as it is just in the front, and watch completely
throughout all that stuff but, what the most important thing is that
the goddamn soul does not ever belong to it.</p>

<p>I walked out from the shadow, but I didn’t see the light. Just like a
fish that got to the dryland, with loneliness and helplessness.
<!-- more -->
It’s a return, a return of myself, return of myself from two years
ago. The only changed thing is time, while the time’s still works on
it’s fixed routine.</p>

<p>I touched <a href="http://ruby-lang.org">ruby</a> few months ago and then soon
attracted by the beautiful syntactic sugars, functional programming
features and the completely OO. Now, I could be able to use it as
practiced as using python, maybe even better. Honestly, I have never
really liked <a href="http://python.org">python</a> or suchlike, or rudely, it
just looks like a piece of shit.</p>

<p>I’m on the way to release, after then, you’ll got a new version of
Mutation. However, the only improvement is the technique and the
better science views; stuff like imagination, sorry, forgive me, is
fully dead.</p>

<p>Just mentioned about my imagination, have to note that I’m still
advocating I’m a good thinker. Sometimes I will think of myself, and
got I’m actually a schizophrenia as expected.</p>

<p>The other reality is that I’m returning to the campus life. Okay,
can’t deny it’s a shame and a joke among many my friends. I won’t
correct them in my way. A change, or a decision, maybe just came out
from a mind, and that is exactly what it is. Yep, everything were
created in that way, including Mutation, dreamworlds and even this
cosmos. Do comment and spread it freely, I won’t mind.</p>

<p>I walk on the lane with slight winds, feeling the last peace from my
heart. Everything is gone, or it never have been.</p>

<p>Why have I to do as a busy insect in the fixed paths? Why can’t I bear
to live as a machine? Okay, they are META problems of the universe, I
myself can’t answer it, while my host can.</p>

<p>Things are being blur. I am not sad any more. How could I be so blue
under such beautiful violins! I’m not cured as I said, and I’m not
gotten rid from Mutation yet. The world should not be like this, and
no one will know where the perfect prototype could be found.</p>

<p>Substantial is me, and I just need a «<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker's_Guide_to_the_Galaxy">Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Outer
World</a>». While unfortunately, I should be the author of it.</p>

<p>When to get out is already suggested, though I don’t like to accept
it. Soon later just, good bye to earthmen and all created lifes then!</p>

<p>Schizophrenia am I, eh?
Not longer it will be, 8 months remaining only. Good lucky.</p>

<!-- *P.s. please don't mind the sorrows in the text, maybe you could
 regard it as a practice of English language. Keep smiling all the
 time and enjoy the happiness from the emptiness.* -->

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>10 months remaining.</p>

<p>Well, the month could be summarized as the word ‘dream’.</p>

<p>Since the short dreamworld control last month, I have been
experienced up to five or six times of wonderful dreamworld controls.
Not exactly, some of my dream, actually, are nightmare, while
the protagonist knows who himself is.</p>

<p>And currently I’m keeping to write my
<a href="https://github.com/shouya/ruby-cscript">cscript</a>, which will be a
script language with c-like syntax.</p>

<p>While the period, I learnt some
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yacc">yacc</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lex_programming_tool">lex</a>
and some tricks from that.</p>

<p>For programming, I even touched a bit Ruby and django framework for python.</p>
