Hello, my name is Shou Ya (亞首). I am a Haskell and Ruby programmer.

In philosophy, I believe in
[solipsism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solipsism). 'Host' (or
'hosto'), as mentioned frequently in some posts, is the
god of myself and the godish character of myself.

I am a great fan of pure mathematics, especially the abstract branches
such as logics,
[category theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory) and
[abstract algebra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_algebra). Using
[Coq](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coq) to prove theorems I read on
math books is one of my favorite entertainment fashions.

I love [baroque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baroque) music
and symphonies. I also listen to Japanese anime songs and original
sound tracks of my favorite movies. Yet I don't like rock and heavy music
at all.

Besides, I enjoy watching Japanese anime. My favorite series is
[Serial Experiments Lain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Experiments_Lain). In
addition to Lain, I appreciate
[Madoka Magica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puella_Magi_Madoka_Magica),
[From the New World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_the_New_World_%28novel%29),
and [Psycho-Pass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psycho-Pass) ([II](http://myanimelist.net/anime/23281/Psycho-Pass_2)) very much
as well. I adore moe(萌え) characters as many ACG folks do.

If you're looking for the works I've done, you can check out
my [projects](https://github.com/shouya) and
[gists](https://gist.github.com).

In this blog are mainly published personal notes about psychology and
technique. I hope you enjoy them.
