Hello, anyone there? This is Shou speaking. Welcome to my website.

You can find my random thoughts and (mostly inaccurate) technical sharings here. Some articles may contain emotionally depressing content. All posts on this website are licensed under CC BY-SA license.

My fields of interest include functional programming, maths, linguistics and philosophy. Also I sometimes hack Linux for fun.

You may contact me via the means listed below.
