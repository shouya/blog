## Introduction
The book
[Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/)
was bought for months. I previewed a few chapters from beginning, and
found the greatness of this classic.

Unlike those time I dropped out at home, when I was schooling, I
busied on innumerable things and social activities, not realized
that time elapsed so fast. While now I am going to repick my major
interest, to continue my personal study on computer science.

SICP is a nice book to begin with. Meanwhile I was also learning
Haskell and Racket, intending to bring a conceptual operating
system out of my mind. And besides I am now attending a SAT
camp. Although the study tasks are very intense and occupied nearly
all my day time, I can still do something else in evening if I could
plan it well. I wish I can read one or two sub-chapters each day, and
I will do the exercise questions and take notes carefully. This page
shall be updated daily.

I have an interesting anecdote about SICP with Professor
[Hal Abelson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hal_Abelson).
One afternoon in last semester my computer teacher suddenly asked me
to receive some guests from MIT. I felt surprising for that.
They were Hal and his two students, and were to attend
the [AppInventor](http://appinventor.mit.edu) workshop later.

They visited the computer room in my school and I showed them some of
my projects including my [revo](https://github.com/shouya/revo), a
scheme interpreter. In conversation I told Hal I was right reading
SICP, and he responded in smile: 'Oh? Do you like that?' And I
expressed my admire to the classic. Meantime I don't yet know
he is one of the authors of the book since I rarely notice the
author's name of a book. I got who he is at the next day, by
querying the info of the visitors on Wikipedia. I was quite
astonished. So in the following days I was invited to the AppInventor
workshop with a teacher, I met Hal again and asked a signature from
him on the book. It was a great time me to know such a master. Lucky
was I. Above attaches a photo of his autograph. I feel proud to have
it.
