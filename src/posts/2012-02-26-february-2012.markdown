10 months remaining.

Well, the month could be summarized as the word 'dream'.

Since the short dreamworld control last month, I have been
experienced up to five or six times of wonderful dreamworld controls.
Not exactly, some of my dream, actually, are nightmare, while
the protagonist knows who himself is.

And currently I'm keeping to write my
[cscript](https://github.com/shouya/ruby-cscript), which will be a
script language with c-like syntax.

While the period, I learnt some
[yacc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yacc)/[lex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lex_programming_tool)
and some tricks from that.

For programming, I even touched a bit Ruby and django framework for python.

I was cured, all right!
